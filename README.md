Hi, I'm Jake
Thanks for looking at my Github Readme. I write web applications for a living. I love music (country music, not so much), my family, and my dogs.
I mostly write in Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
I am working on learning all aspects of Salesforce administration and lightning development.
